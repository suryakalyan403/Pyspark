## PROBLEM STATEMENT

UnitedHealth Group has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows members to call an advocate and receive support for their health
care needs â€“ whether that's behavioural, clinical, well-being, health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help.
Write a query to get the patients who made a call within 7 days of their previous call. If a patient called more than twice in a span of 7
days, count them as once.
